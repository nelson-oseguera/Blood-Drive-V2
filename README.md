# Blood-Drive-V2

The American Red Cross wants you to write a program that will calculate the average pints of blood donated during a blood drive.  The program should take in the number of pints donated during the drive, based on a seven hour drive period.  The average pints donated during that period should be calculated and written to a file.  If the user wants to print data from the file, read it in and then display it.  Store the pints per hour and the average pints donated in a file called blood.txt.
